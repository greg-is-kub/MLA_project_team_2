This github page is the result of the project made for the Advanced Machine Learning Course from Sorbonnes Universités.
Through our rapport, we are examining the solutions developed by the data scientist community for the automatic diagnosis of Covid-19 with X-Ray scans. We then proposed some solutions to this problem based on the dataset that we have chosen.

* *CNN* contains the base model created
* *CNN_deeper* contains the upgraded model of CNN.
* *research_paper_covid_dual.ipynb* contains the test made for the dual architecture deployed.
* **database** contains the classes that we used.
